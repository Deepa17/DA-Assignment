The target variable is analysed carefully and when decomposed trend and seasonality are observed. Hence, the above model is used for forecasting. All variations of the model have been tried out to obtain the best results. <br>

<b>Linear Regression as a part of regression </br>

A pipeline was used with StandardScaler for preprocessing
